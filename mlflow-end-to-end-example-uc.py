# MAGIC
# MAGIC This tutorial shows you how to train and register Models in Unity Catalog. Databricks includes a hosted MLflow Model Registry in Unity Catalog, compatible with the open-source MLflow Python client. Benefits include centralized access control, auditing, lineage, and model discovery across workspaces. For details about managing the model lifecycle with Unity Catalog, see ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/) | [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html)).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This tutorial covers the following steps:
# MAGIC - Visualize the data using Seaborn and matplotlib
# MAGIC - Run a parallel hyperparameter sweep to train multiple models
# MAGIC - Explore hyperparameter sweep results with MLflow
# MAGIC - Register the best performing model in MLflow
# MAGIC - Apply the registered model to another dataset using a Spark UDF
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this example, you build a model to predict the quality of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine based on the wine's physicochemical properties. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The example uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, presented in [*Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923609001377?via%3Dihub) [Cortez et al., 2009].

# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC This notebook requires Databricks Runtime for Machine Learning.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook requires a workspace that has been enabled for Unity Catalog. A version for workspaces not enabled for Unity Catalog is available: ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/mlflow/end-to-end-example.html) | [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/mlflow/end-to-end-example) | [GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/mlflow/end-to-end-example.html)).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Unity Catalog setup
# MAGIC Set the catalog and schema where the model will be registered. You must have USE CATALOG privilege on the catalog, and CREATE MODEL and USE SCHEMA privileges on the schema. Change the catalog and schema here if necessary.

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow

mlflow.set_registry_uri("databricks-uc")
CATALOG_NAME = "main"
SCHEMA_NAME = "default"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Read the data
# MAGIC Read the white wine quality and red wine quality CSV datasets and merge them into a single DataFrame.

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd

white_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
red_wine = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")
display(red_wine)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0

data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0)

# Remove spaces from column names
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)

# COMMAND ----------

data.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Visualize data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before training a model, explore the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(data.quality, kde=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Box plots are useful for identifying correlations between features and a binary label. Create box plots for each feature to compare high-quality and low-quality wines. Significant differences in the box plots indicate good predictors of quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

dims = (3, 4)

f, axes = plt.subplots(dims[0], dims[1], figsize=(25, 15))
axis_i, axis_j = 0, 0
for col in data.columns:
  if col == 'is_red' or col == 'quality':
    continue # Box plots cannot be used on indicator variables
  sns.boxplot(x=high_quality, y=data[col], ax=axes[axis_i, axis_j])
  axis_j += 1
  if axis_j == dims[1]:
    axis_i += 1
    axis_j = 0

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md In the above box plots, a few variables stand out as good univariate predictors of quality. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the alcohol box plot, the median alcohol content of high quality wines is greater than even the 75th quantile of low quality wines. High alcohol content is correlated with quality.
# MAGIC - In the density box plot, low quality wines have a greater density than high quality wines. Density is inversely correlated with quality.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Preprocess data
# MAGIC Before training a model, check for missing values and split the data into training and validation sets.

# COMMAND ----------

data.isna().any()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md There are no missing values.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Prepare the dataset to train a baseline model
# MAGIC Split the input data into 3 sets:
# MAGIC - Train (60% of the dataset used to train the model)
# MAGIC - Validation (20% of the dataset used to tune the hyperparameters)
# MAGIC - Test (20% of the dataset used to report the true performance of the model on an unseen dataset)

# COMMAND ----------

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data.drop(["quality"], axis=1)
y = data.quality

# Split out the training data
X_train, X_rem, y_train, y_rem = train_test_split(X, y, train_size=0.6, random_state=123)

# Split the remaining data equally into validation and test
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_rem, y_rem, test_size=0.5, random_state=123)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Train a baseline model
# MAGIC This task seems well suited to a random forest classifier, since the output is binary and there may be interactions between multiple variables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Build a simple classifier using scikit-learn and use MLflow to keep track of the model's accuracy and save the model for later use.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC The model achieved an AUC of 0.854.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/_static/images/mlflow/end-to-end-example/model-in-uc.png"/>

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Evaluate the model on data stored in a Delta table, using Spark to run the computation in parallel.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Serve the model
# MAGIC To productionize the model for low latency predictions, use Databricks Model Serving to deploy the model to an endpoint. Databricks Model Serving is available in AWS and Azure workspaces.
